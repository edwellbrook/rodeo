![Rodeo Preview](https://github.com/edwellbrook/Rodeo/raw/master/preview.png "Rodeo Safari Exension")

##What's Rodeo?
Rodeo is a Chrome/Safari extension made by [Ed Wellbrook](http://edwellbrook.com/) and packaged by [Preshit Deorukhkar](http://nuclearbits.com/) to improve the design and overall experience of [Feed Wrangler](http://feedwrangler.net), a great paid RSS reading service by [David Smith](http://david-smith.org) as a Google Reader alternative after it's shutdown.

How is this fork different than the original Rodeo?
This fork is a recolored version of Rodeo to better fit in with Feed Wrangler. Feed Wrangler uses Light Blue as it's main color both on the main site and the iOS apps, and the original Rodeo uses Orange and Black. This fork changes the look of the Rodeo to use Light Blue.
