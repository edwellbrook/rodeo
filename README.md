#Rodeo for Feed Wrangler

##What's Rodeo?
Rodeo is a Chrome/Safari extension made by [Ed Wellbrook](http://edwellbrook.com/) and packaged by [Preshit Deorukhkar](http://nuclearbits.com/) to improve the design and overall experience of [Feed Wrangler](http://feedwrangler.net), a great paid RSS reading service created by [David Smith](http://david-smith.org) as a Google Reader alternative after it's shutdown.

##Why Create Rodeo?
Unfortunately, Feed Wrangler's design wasn't as good as some people would like from a paid service, so Rodeo was made to improve that.

##How is this fork different than the original Rodeo?
This fork is a recolored version of Rodeo to better fit in with Feed Wrangler. Feed Wrangler uses Blue as it's main color both on the main site and the iOS apps, and the original Rodeo uses Orange and Black. This fork changes the look of the Rodeo to use Blue colors.

If you want to take a look at the original Rodeo, you can find it here: [https://github.com/edwellbrook/Rodeo](https://github.com/edwellbrook/Rodeo)

##How Do I Install Rodeo?
Installing Rodeo is really easy. You can do so by installing either the Safari or Google Chrome extension from the releases section (NOTE: Chrome users have to drag the extension into the extension manager `chrome://extensions/`):

Download Rodeo Blue from here (currently only the Chrome extension is ready, Safari needs to be packaged):
